   <h2> Why English x Programming?</h2>
   <img src="images/WonderConceptDesign_fixed.PNG" style="width:100%">
   <h3> English </h3>
   <p>The world's English-speaking population has grown to 1.75 billion, or about 25% of the total population of 7 billion. The ability to use English is an important skill required in this global age.</p>
   <h3> Programming </h3>
   <p>It is predicted that by 2035, approximately 50% of jobs will be replaceable by AI and robots. Programming is a necessary skill to coexist with technology.</p>

    <h2>English and Computational Thinking </h2>
    <p>What social changes do you foresee in the 2020 education reform? We are committed to nurturing the skills needed for children to play an active role in a global society and to nurture the leaders of the future. We nurture the skills needed for children to play an active role in a global society and develop leaders for the future.</p>
    <p>In recent years, technological innovation through the use of AI and robots has been rapid. Many things that are taken for granted today would have been completely unimaginable 10-20 years ago.
       According to a McKinsey & Company study published in 2020, by 2030, 27% of Japanese work will be automated, potentially replacing 16.6 million jobs. In the near future, jobs in all areas will be replaced by technology to varying degrees.</p>
    <p>In the future, people will be required to develop the qualities and abilities necessary to cope with social changes and realize a world that coexists with technology, as well as the ability to carve out a better society and life.
       In addition, with the spread of the Internet and smartphones, national borders are expected to fade away and globalization will further progress. This means that there is an increasing need to communicate in English, the universal language.
       These two social backgrounds, "technological innovation" and "globalization," are related to the 2020 education reform.</p>
    <p>In postwar Japan, the emphasis was on group cohesion and "horizontal education" for the sake of reconstruction. This was followed by a "cramming" style of education that emphasized "how much knowledge one can acquire and how quickly and accurately one can solve problems," a policy that has continued until recently.
       The new educational reform, however, requires that the students learn what kind of skills they need to acquire and what they should be able to do.
       In elementary schools, "foreign language education" and "programming education" have become compulsory, and the emphasis is on being able to communicate in English and developing programming thinking.</p>
    <p>We hope to provide curricula that nurture these skills and expand the possibilities of the children who will lead the future.</p>
